# fbrp.js
When I was designing FBRP, I created a prototype in JavaScript before  
the real [C implementation](https://code.heb12.com/heb12/fbrp). Beware, the code is very messy and definitely  
not my best.  

Feel free to send any pull requests. I'm even open to a different code style.  

# Usage"
You'll find a good bit of comments in the code.
The return object is fairly straightforward to parse.
```
node fbrp.js
```
